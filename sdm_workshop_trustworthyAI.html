<p><font size="5">
This workshop aims to demonstrate the recent research progress of trustworthy AI for structural data and focuses on addressing the unique challenges in healthcare fields, including trustworthy data and trustworthy models, such as the gaps in data quality, data privacy, domain-experts-in-the-loop data analytics. We invite submissions that focus on recent advances in research/development of data mining and AI, which are motivated by real-world problems and clinic datasets in healthcare. </font></p>


<p><font size="6"> <b> Content </b></font></p>
<font size="5">
In 2018, approximately 22 billion connected devices were in use around the world. In 2025, it may be around 38.6 billion. As we can see the increasing of smart devices, we anticipate that there will be an increasing amount of data collected from those devices. With massive amounts of sensor data collected everywhere, we have entered an era for a much greater understanding of complex behavior through trustworthy AI for structural data and its applications.</font></p>

      <h1 class="text-center pb-4"><b>Description of the format</b></h1>
	<p> In full day workshop, we would include 5 keynote speakers and 3 contributing paper presentations. Each keynote speaker would present for 40 minutes and each contributing paper would present for 15 minutes. The workshop would start with welcome and opening remarks, the follow with two keynote speakers, and two contributing paper presentations. We would have a lunch break. In the afternoon session, it starts with three keynote speakers and one ontributing paper presentation and closing remarks.
